# Maximum simultaneous async chunk generation requests in-flight at once.
# Higher = faster generation but more memory/CPU usage.
# Recommended: 4–16 depending on your server hardware.
# DonutSMP-style aggressive: 16
# Safe for low-end servers: 4

# How often (in server ticks) the generation engine fires new chunk requests.
# 1 = every tick (fastest, recommended for Purpur)
# 2 = every other tick (gentler)

# Maximum allowed radius in chunks (safety limit).
# radius=1000 = 2001x2001 chunks = ~4 million chunks — use carefully.
max-radius: 5000

# How often (seconds) to broadcast progress to players with chunkloader.notify.
# Set to 0 to disable progress broadcasts.

# Skip already-generated chunks instead of regenerating them.
# ALWAYS leave this true — regenerating existing chunks destroys player builds.
